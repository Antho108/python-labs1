<h1 id="python-201-procedural-programming">Python 201 - Procedural Programming</h1>
<p>These are the exercise labs for the second module of your CodingNomads Python Programming course.</p>
<p>You should find this document after downloading the repository. This folder contains <strong>your own copy</strong> of all the labs that you'll work with and learn from. Complete the exercises locally on your computer in your text editor or IDE.</p>
<h2 id="use-github-for-feedback">Use GitHub For Feedback</h2>
<p>After you've learned about Git and GitHub, you can add a new remote to your labs folder and point it to a fresh GitHub repository on your own GitHub account.</p>
<p>Push your work there, and inform <a href="https://codingnomads.co/online-coding-bootcamp-mentorship">your mentor</a> through chat or email if you want their feedback on any of the exercises. Even if you aren't working with a mentor, you can link to the code files you want to discuss in the <a href="https://forum.codingnomads.co/">CodingNomads Forum</a>. GitHub is built for collaboration, so it's a helpful tool in all of this.</p>
<h2 id="contribute">Contribute</h2>
<p>There is always room for improvement, and as a budding software developer, learning to contribute to a project is a great first step to practice remote collaboration and learn about open-source software development practices.</p>
<p>CodingNomads appreciates Pull Requests. If you <strong>find a typo</strong>, or a <strong>mistake in the code</strong>, or if you want to <strong>add an exercise</strong> of your own for other students to learn from, you can suggest these improvements to the original repository.</p>
